# It is not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  If you want to customize, the best
# way is to use the "systemctl edit" command to create an override unit.

# For example, to pass additional options (for instance,
# --no-category=software) to the agent at startup, create an override unit
# (as is done by systemctl edit) and enter the following:

# [Service]
# Environment="OPTIONS=--no-category=software"

[Unit]
Description=FusionInventory agent
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/fusioninventory-agent --daemon --no-fork $OPTIONS
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
